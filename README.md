# AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is a clone of the AirBnB website, implementing a custom command-line interface for managing objects like users, places, amenities, and reviews. 

## Getting Started

To launch the console application:

```
./console.py
```

Once launched, you can use commands like:

- `create`: Create a new object (ex: `create User`)
- `show`: Show an object's details (ex: `show User my_id`) 
- `all`: Display all objects of a type (ex: `all Users`)
- `update`: Update an object's attributes (ex: `update User my_id email "new@email.com"`)
- `destroy`: Destroy an object (ex: `destroy User my_id`)

Type `help` to see all available commands.
